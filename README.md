### PHP BEYOND THE WEB

This repo has some scripts I followed from the book PHP Beyond The Web by Rob Aley.
I will highly encourage every PHP programmer to read this book as it conntains a lot of 
uncommon things that can be achieved while working with PHP.

It also has a lot of external resources to check out.
